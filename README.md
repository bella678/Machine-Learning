# Machine-Learning
Recently, the huge amounts of data and its incremental increase have changed the importance of information security and data analysis systems for Big Data. Intrusion detection system (IDS) is a system that monitors and analyses data to detect any intrusion in the system or network. Traditional intrusion detection system techniques make the system more complex and less efficient when dealing with huge data, because its analysis properties process is complex and take a long time. The long time it takes to analyse the data makes the system prone to harms for some period of time before getting any alert. In this project, different machine learning algorithms have been used  for training the IDSâ€™s and finding the most accurate among them.
